# FMG Game (Working Title)

## Created by DidYouLikeMySunglasses

This is my go at a Life Sim the follows the life of a young adult girl who experiences muscle growth.

As of right now, a lot of the options are limited as I am still actively developing the game on the weekends.

I took a lot of inspiration from existing FMG Life Sim games out there and a big motivation for it was my absolute distain for current "Choose your own adventure" engines such as "SugarCube" as I found the longer I tended to play, the worse my performance would get a lot of the time (especially on mobile). My goal here is to maybe give them some competition and possibly put the engine I've built alone into it's own seperate open source repository seperate from this one that people can fork to create their own games... -but that's far down the line and greatly depends on how popular this becomes!
