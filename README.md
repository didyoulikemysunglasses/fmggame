# FMG Game (Working Title)

Created by DidYouLikeMySunglasses

This is my go at a Life Sim the follows the life of a young adult girl who experiences muscle growth.

As of right now, a lot of the options are limited as I haven't been actively working on this, and have really only been doing work on it spontaneously.

I took a lot of inspiration from existing FMG Life Sim games out there and wanted to try my hand at building something like this using plain old vanilla JavaScript instead of those "Choose your own adventure" engines such as "Twine" or "SugarCube".

## How to play
