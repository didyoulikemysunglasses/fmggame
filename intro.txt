My name is Stacy.

At 5'2" and 100lbs, I am a bone-thin skinny looking girl in my early 20s.

I graduated highschool a few years back and didn't really do much after... -aside from fucking around on the internet and playing games all day...

After highschool, all of my friends-

-wait... who am I kidding... I didn't have friends in highschool...

-After highschool, all of my ACQUAINTANCES went to college, leaving me less and less reasons to leave the house.

I um...

I still live with Mom currently...

-for now.

I mean, my older brother, Tom, lives with us too! 

-And he's Jobless too, so if anything, it's up to him to get his shit together first since he's older...

-Right? 

I mean, I'm SURE I'll find a job and move out EVENTUALLY...

But... 

Today's not the day for that...

====================
NEXT DAY
====================

After a long day of watching YouTube videos, I decide to head downstairs and grab some food.

I've been watching a bunch of make-up tutorial videos non-stop...

I don't even know why: I don't even USE make-up!

I just can't stop watching them...

While I eat, I hear the door open.

My meathead of an older brother, Tom, walks in with a goofy smile on his face.

He towers over both me and Mom at 6'0" tall, at a somewhat solid 180lbs.

"Guess who just landed a Job!" Tom exclaims.

"OH MY GOODNESS! I am SO happy for you, Tom!" My mom cries, running over to Tom and hugging him tightly.

"Hey... Nice job, Bro." I say, trying my best to fake enthusiasm...

Stupid tryhard idiot... now that he's got a job, I'm going to start looking like the fuck-up kid of the family...

"Where are you working?" Mom asks, letting go of Tom.

"It's a construction gig, just down the road from here. Full-time with Union benefits." Tom says, putting his hands on his hips proudly.

"-UNION BENEFITS!" Mom yells, with a couple of claps.

I'm not even sure if that bitch knows what a Union is... -She's just excited that he's got a chance to move out now.

"Now it looks like it's your sister's turn to get a Job." Mom says, giving me a wink.

I return the wink with a weak smile.

Oh god. 

The pressure is on.

==================
Next Day
==================

I wake up feeling a sense of dread.

My idiot brother has a job and I don't...

Mom is going to be hounding me like crazy...

==================
Go Downstairs
==================

Mom and Tom are downstairs sitting at the kitchen table eating breakfast.

Tom is dressed in his construction worker uniform.

"Maybe you can get your sister a Job with you construction, Tom?" Mom asks.

"Yeah right!" Tom laughs. "I bet a little shrimp like her couldn't even lift a hammer!"
