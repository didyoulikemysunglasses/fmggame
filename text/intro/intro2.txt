After a long day of watching YouTube videos, I decide to head downstairs and grab some food.

I've been watching a bunch of make-up tutorial videos non-stop...

I don't even know why: I don't even USE make-up!

I just can't stop watching them...

While I eat, I hear the door open.

My meathead of an older brother, %gameData.npcs.brother.name%, walks in with a goofy smile on his face.

He towers over both me and Mom at 5'10" tall, at a somewhat solid 160lbs.

"Guess who just landed a Job!" %gameData.npcs.brother.name% exclaims.

"OH MY GOODNESS! I am SO happy for you, %gameData.npcs.brother.name%!" My mom cries, running over to %gameData.npcs.brother.name% and hugging him tightly.

"Hey... Nice job, Bro." I say, trying my best to fake enthusiasm...

Stupid tryhard idiot... now that he's got a job, I'm going to start looking like the fuck-up kid of the family...

"Where are you working?" Mom asks, letting go of %gameData.npcs.brother.name%.

"It's a construction gig, just down the road from here. Full-time with Union benefits." %gameData.npcs.brother.name% says, putting his hands on his hips proudly.

"-UNION BENEFITS!" Mom yells, with a couple of claps.

I'm not even sure if that bitch knows what a Union is with the way those corporate overlords work her at her job... -She's just excited that he's got a chance to move out now.

"Now it looks like it's your sister's turn to get a Job." Mom says, giving me a wink.

I return the wink with a weak smile.

Oh god. 

The pressure is on.
