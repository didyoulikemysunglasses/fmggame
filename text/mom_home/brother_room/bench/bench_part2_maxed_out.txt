I load the bar up with 255 pounds...

I could probably do more, at this point, but that's all the weight that %gameData.npcs.brother.name% keeps up here...

-maybe I should pester him to buy more weights...

...

Eh... He might get self consious that his litte sister is outlifting him, maybe not...

...

I get down on the bench and unrack it...

One, Two, Three, Four...

My chest gets a nice pump each time as I lower the bar...

I continue repping the weight up and down...

My massive capped shoulders buldging as I slowly let the bar down to my chest...

My horseshoe triceps flexing as I push the bar back up...

-this weight has become too easy for me, at this point I'll get a way better workout if I were to go to the gym...
