I load the bar up with %eval(staticData.liftingFormulas.benchPress)%.

It's not much, but hey, it's better than where I started!

I get down on the bench and unrack it...

One...

Two...

Three...

I continue to pump out some reps.

I'm still not very good at this, but I think I'm starting to get the hang of it...

%gameData.npcs.brother.name%'s bench press is a little crappy, so I'm not sure if I would get as good of a workout in here, than I would at a gym, but at least here I don't have to worry about other people judging me...
