I load the bar up with %eval(staticData.liftingFormulas.benchPress)%.

I think I'm starting to get a hang of this...

I lay myself down on the bench and unrack it...

One... Two... Three...

I feel it in my chest, shoulders and triceps as I bang out rep after rep with the weight, trying my best to keep perfect form...

Once I'm pretty sure I can't do anymore, I re-rack the weight and sit up.

I put my hand under my shirt to feel my pecs...

Whoa...

I'm starting to get muscles there...

I wonder what will happen if I keep lifting like this...
