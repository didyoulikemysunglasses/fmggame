I load the bar up with %eval(staticData.liftingFormulas.benchPress)%.

I'm finally lifting a competent amount of weight...

I wonder how much %gameData.npcs.brother.name% usually lifts with this thing...

I scoot myself under the bench and lift the bar...

One, Two... 

Three...

I'm starting to get to the point where I don't have to focus on my form as much when I do this...

I can just focus everything into trying to lift as much as I can...

Watching as I continue to push the bar back up, I see my sizable triceps flexing as I lock the bar out at the top, before I bring it back down to my ripped chest again.

When I'm done with the set, I re-rack the bar...

...

I look around the room to make sure I'm alone...

-I am...

Good...

I take off my shirt and look down at my body...

My pecs fill out my sports-bra and my large shoulders would look intimidating to the average joe...

...

Maybe I'll do this next set with my shirt off...
