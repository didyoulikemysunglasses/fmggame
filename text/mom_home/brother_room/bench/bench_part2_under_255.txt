I load the bar up with %eval(staticData.liftingFormulas.benchPress)%.

Shit, I'm lifting a lot of weight...

I'll bet that's more than %gameData.npcs.brother.name% can lift with this hunk of junk bench press...

I get under the bench and start my set...

One, Two, Three...

My form is getting really good...

Everytime I push the bar back up, I can feel the power of my mighty chest pushing it back up... My strong triceps and shoulders assisting in the motion...

I continue my set until I'm sure I can't do anymore, and re-rack the bar...

Shit... I'm going to be outgrowing this bench soon...

Either that or %gameData.npcs.brother.name% is going to have to buy more weights for this thing...
