No one's in %gameData.npcs.brother.name%'s room...

%gameData.npcs.brother.name% is definitely my brother, that's for sure...

He keeps his room just as tidy as mine.

-which is to say, "not at all".

Heavy metal posters cover the walls, and dirty clothes cover the floor...

Underneath the piles of clothes, it seems he also has a bench press in here with a few small weights that can be swapped in and out on the bar.
