I go to turn the knob of %gameData.npcs.brother.name%'s room.

...

It won't open...

...

"%gameData.player.name%, stay out of my room!" I hear %gameData.npcs.brother.name% yell from the other side of the door.

Jesus... I didn't realize he was so overprotective about his bench press...

Hopefully he chills out tomorrow...
