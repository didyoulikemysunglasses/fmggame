I'm outmatched...

...

I'm still standing... -but I don't have much fight left in me...

%gameData.npcs.brother.name% stands opposite of me.

"Dear sister, I am a believer in gender equality." He says with a smile.

I try my best not to wince...

"Do you know what that means?" He says, clenching a fist of his own.

"That- ...you're going to let me go?" I say, nervously.

His arm begins to move...

-and slams directly into my face!

Fuck!

I was sent straight to the floor with a single punch from him...

"It means that I'm not afraid to hit you. Now get out..." %gameData.npcs.brother.name% grumbles.
