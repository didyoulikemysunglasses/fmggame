%gameData.npcs.brother.name% comes stumbling in through the door drunkenly.

"What's up, bro?" I say, with a slight grin on my face.

"I am feeling NICE... Nice! nice! nice..." %gameData.npcs.brother.name% exclaims as his grabs a glass and begins filling it with water using the sink.

Once it's filled, he goes to take a sip, and pours half of it on himself.

"Did they uh... -give you enough to drink at the bar?" I quip.

"Oh yeah... -they took care of me there!" He says, oblivious to my comment.

"Someone's gotta..." I say, as he heads upstairs...

I hear the sound of his door crashing shut.

Good night, %gameData.npcs.brother.name%.
