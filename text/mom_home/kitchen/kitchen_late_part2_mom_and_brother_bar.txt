%gameData.npcs.brother.name% comes stumbling in through the door drunkenly.

-and he's followed by a GIRL???

...

wait... no that's just Mom.

"Hey %gameData.player.name%" she says, waving.

Wait...

-did they go out drinking together?

"I guess we both had rough days at work," %gameData.npcs.brother.name% says "-because we both ended up at the same bar at the end of our shifts..."

"Bedtime..." Mom says sleepily as she stumbles her way upstairs.

After a few moments, I hear her door close.

"Is she going to be alright?" I ask.

"-Of course!" %gameData.npcs.brother.name% says with drunken gusto. "You know, %gameData.player.name%... You really gotta come out drinking with us sometime, man."

He slaps me on the back and heads slowly heads up the stairs.

"I'll think about it."
