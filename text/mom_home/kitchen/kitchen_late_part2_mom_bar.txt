I hear the door creak open.

I wait a moment and don't hear anyone.

"Hello?" I question, leaning over to see if anyone is at the door.

Slowly and clumsily, Mom walks in.

Her hair looks dishevelled, and reeks of booze.

"Hey... %gameData.player.name%... Jus- *hic*... -just coming back from work here... nothin' to see..." she mutters.

I walk over to her, and give her a shoulder to lean on. "It's okay, I can help you walk up to your room."

"Why would I- *hic*... -need help? I'm just fine! -looks it's me mom! -back from a late workin' shift..." she spouts at me.

I give her a weak smile as I help her up the stairs.

"Of course... -of course..." I play along.

Soon enough, she's in her room and I'm back down in the kitchen by myself.
