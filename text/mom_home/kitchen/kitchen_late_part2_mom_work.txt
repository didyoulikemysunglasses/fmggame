I hear the door creak open, and Mom walks in, still dressed in her work clothes.

"What are you still doing up?" she asks.

"I could ask you the same thing myself..." I deflect back at her.

"You know how it is at work for us right now..." Mom says, fixing herself a tumbler of whiskey. "All of us are up to our asses with paperwork..."

I nod.

-shit those corporate fuck-tards are really working her to the bone...

Mom begins to walk upstairs and stops for a moment.

"Please do remember to get your sleep, %gameData.player.name%... I know you're older now, but sleep is still important! -even if you aren't a growing girl anymore."

I smirk.

"Sure thing, Mom."
