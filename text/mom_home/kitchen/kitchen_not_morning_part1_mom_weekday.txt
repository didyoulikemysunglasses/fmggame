I head into the kitchen.

Mom is watching TV...

"You're home early." I remark.

"Yeah, for once we actually got caught-up on paperwork, so I was able to slip out early."

Hey, that's good... I'm actually happy for Mom...

"How goes the job search, %gameData.player.name%?"

...

"Fine..." I say hesitantly...

-I can't believe that stupid dumb whore has to ruin my mood like that...
