I've got the upper body of a highschool swimmer now...

Despite the fact I graduated highschool a few years ago...

-and I don't really know how to swim...

But hey, I'm just a late bloomer I guess...

And if that means wider shoulders, lean arms and faint six pack and, I'm not complaining...
